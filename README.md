## Purpose

This repo collects all the tricks to help smash [type-challenges](https://github.com/type-challenges/type-challenges/)

## How to cheat

The collection is under `./lib`.

Every exported type has a corresponding test(under `./test`) 
to inspire you to think what it does.

The type without an export is just for illustration purpose, 
and the comment around will help.

`./lib/challenges.ts` collects some real-world examples that utilize the foundation established in `cheatsheet`


### Enjoy learning :)
